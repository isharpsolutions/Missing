Missing
=======

This provides a library that encapsulates common tasks that we (iSharp Solutions) use in almost all of our projects.

It is based on an internal library that we now wish to share with the world and our clients.

Our goal is to make a lightweight library that is easy to use and understand and does not get in your way.


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Missing will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
